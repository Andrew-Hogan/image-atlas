# image-atlas - Like a good CPython pixel, neighbors are there.


Eek! You've caught us in progress. This sweet, sweet general-purpose lasagna is being extracted some spaghetti. Please
forgetti you even saw anything.

Sorry we didn't include documentation for what is here, pretty much everything has changed. You can get some pretty
fast 4-connected pixel neighbors from object classes of your choosing anyways though!
